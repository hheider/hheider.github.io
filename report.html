Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font.
Your site must include links to external sites. Clicking on external links must open a new tab or window rather than replace your page.
Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for classes and IDs.
Your site's webpages should include a consistent navbar. 
Your site's webpages should include some sort of header and footer section along with the navbar. 
Your site's webpages should implement flexboxes/grids or a combination of both.
