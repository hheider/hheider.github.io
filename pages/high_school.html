                    High School Team
                </h1>
                <p>The High School Team is open to all area high school students, regardless of XC skiing experience.</p>
                <p>Our team focuses on building endurance, techniques, and positive mindsets in a fun (and beautiful!) 
                    environment. Participants lean both classic and skating techniques.</p>
                <p>We are a member of the <a href="https://www.wisconsinxcski.org" target="_blank">Wisconsin Nordic Ski League</a> 
                    and belong to the Southern Conference, which includes Peak Nordic, Northern Kettle Moraine Nordic, 
                    Madison Nordic, and Blackhawk Nordic.</p> 
                <p>The season runs November through February, with additional dryland practices scattered throughout 
                    the summer and fall. Practices are held in Lodi at the golf course trails, Lodi High School, 
                    Elver Park in Madison, the CXC Center, and the Highway 12/19 bike trail. There are generally 3-4 
                    practices during the week starting at around 4:30, with additional practices on Saturday mornings 
                    at varying times and places.</p>
                <p>Races are held across the state, mostly on weekends in January and February.</p>
                    
                <p>Registration form can be found <a href="hs_ms_registration_form.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Registration includes all 
                    coaching, trail fees, grooming, equipment, and race fees. It does not cover overnight lodging or any 
                    transportation.</p>

                <h2>Coaches:</h2>
                <p>Dale Fanney -- HS Head Coach<br>
                    Retired Family Physician -- coaching for almost 20 years. SafeSport, CPR, and ACLS certified.</p>
                <p>“I would like every junior skier that we coach to develop a love and passion for Nordic skiing 
                    and being active in the winter. Our goal is to develop a skiing skill set that allows the athlete 
                    to feel the joy of gliding on snow through the woods.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Don Fariss -- HS Assistant Coach<br>
